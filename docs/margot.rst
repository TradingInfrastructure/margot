Introduction
============

Our journey with Margot begins with data.

To the quantitative trader, data is the link to the observable universe upon
which we overlaycour ideas, to seek to uncover statistical or seasonality
effects, mispricings or premium for carrying risk.

Margot data aims to provide a framework within which we can encapsulate this
complexity, making the act of defining trading algorithms as declarative and 
as simple as possible.
